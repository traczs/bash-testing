objective
************************
Compute whether or not the result of all the files is "PASS" or "FAIL". Each "PASS" is given a weight of 	
1.25 and each "FAIL" is given a weight of -1.5. A final result of "PASS" is a score >= 0. For example, if 2 "PASS" strings are
found across all files and 2 "FAIL"strings are found across all files, then the resulting final socre would be -0.5. Therefore the
final result would 	be fail. However, if 3 "PASS" strings were found across all files and 2 "FAIL" strings were found across all
files, the reulting final score would be (1.25*3 + (-1.5)*2) = 0.75. Therefore the final result would be "PASS". Display the value of
the final result to the screen and display whether it is "PASS" or "FAIL".
